I sent you a few pics & when I was taking pic I noticed a small dent in chrome ring from speedo but it was on the bike for 5 years & I never noticed it. Both tach & speedo came off a 74 Eldo

is one style less likely to decide to dump the motor oil? (flapper
door vs. disc/spring) thanks

Thanks kevin m … this is a very pertinent and timely post for me.
 If I just go for a soft putt, this doesn’t happen, but if I go for a spirited ride on my Guzzi… and if I come home downhill a particular way, when I turn into my street… my bike is dumping a heap of oil in a big circular trail as I turn. That particular way home, there is about a kilometre of downhill before turning into my street, so the throttle is off and the motor is providing engine braking as I come down the hill. As I put the throttle on to do the turn, that’s when the oil flows. The quantity of oil it dumps is way more than the tiny amount that is coming from the rear main seal via the bell housing… it is embarrassing and dangerous. The vent hose is luckily off to the side, so the oil misses my rear tyre, otherwise I’d be sliding down the road on my ear.
I think I have read somewhere (maybe I imagined it) that the breather box return hose feeds into a pipe that goes below the engine oil level, and some people have changed it so it doesn’t… stopping it pumping oil out.Anyway, I need to sort it as it is dangerous. My next step was to take the original breather box off, block the return hose and make a race style oil breather bottle, mounted up high with a nice long large diameter vertically rsiing hose feeding it and a large diameter hose exiting the new breather bottle.But if that is the wrong approach, I’m happy for the advice.

The proper function of the valve in the breather box is easy to test
without any special tool - if the valve is working sufficiently you have
to search for the cause of the oil loss elsewhere - e.g. worn out
cyl./pistons sets.
