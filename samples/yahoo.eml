I use bar keepers friend with a paintbrush to scrub the cases on my Guzzis . I make a paste with water in a cup and work it into nooks and crannies with the bristles, it leaves the alloy nice and bright, except for some types of alloy like my convert transmission case, which actually turn darker with the oxalic acid scrub. I was able to brighten it afterwards with a red 3m abrasive pad, and a bit of simple green diluted 50%.

Pretty important I'm guessing. I am sure you will have a leak if you don't
use them. Did you assemble without them or are you wanting to assemble but
don't have the o-rings?

Very important to use the correct kind and not just some hardware store, plumbing type o-rings.  They have to be oil/fuel resistant.  Forgot the name but some of the guys with better brain cells will remember.  Bob Hawkes

Hi Robert,I replaced all the o rings except for the two larger ones....the one that is on the stud nut that goes through the head. Â I couldn't get it at the time so I used the old ones...no good. Â My boots and lower pants got all oily on the first ride. Have found the proper replacement o rings and haven't installed them yet. Â In short, I think they are important and hope to keep the oil leaking to a minimum.
Good luck,
MIguelÂ

One of the few things that piss me off about moto Guzzi is you can not reuse any of the gaskets when pulling the heads. Be it o-rings, exhaust rings or gaskets.
If you do you will most likely have a leak.
