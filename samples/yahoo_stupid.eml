2011 Rally was held at Brookside Campground Catskill NY.   Current prices, I doube that it has changed very much. Also the Asheville NC area is very much a " destination area ", probably going to be a bit more $$$. KOA's are generally more money than independents. Great riding around the area too, different than upstate NY, both are beautiful areas to ride. It's only money, just go for a ride!

That is not correct.  The 2011 Empire Rally was held at the Blackthorne Resort in nearby Durham, not at the Brookside Campground in Catskill, NY.  The Tri-State Norton Riders checked it out and deemed Brookside very unacceptable for a number of reasons.  If Brookside is charging $25 for what we saw there, $35 at a quality KOA is a good deal.

You are right, it was at the Blackthorn Resort. How much was the tent  camping there in 2011?
KOA campgrounds tend to have a few extras, I stayed in one KOA that had a building with several hot tubs. It was a good idea in late October riding
 back from the Barber Vintage Festival.

I don’t recall tent camping rates and the Blackthorne website is down.  Rooms in their cabins were $75.  Tough to compare a typical campground to the Blackthorne Resort with a pool, Tiki bar, pub, & dining hall.  Might go there again in June for the Jampot Rally...

I was just on the Blackthorne website. They charge $15 per night per adult (I think we paid less in 2011). I don't know if the Ashville KOA is higher for more people or not, but I am going alone so 35.50 per night is a lot higher than NY was.

Gary
With all the talk of running out of tenting spaces I made my reservation today. As of this afternoon they only had tent sites with electric, no water. Price was 32.50 per night. My site is G29. I thought long and hard about going to a motel but in the end chose the campground so I don't need to ride two up 5 miles back to the motel in the dark.  Our members are staying at the Motel North of the Motel 6. I think their special rate is about 70 per night except for Fri night which is double. Asheville is a very popular tourist spot in July and thus the higher prices. Asheville itself is a popular town for tourists and the Blue Ridge Parkway is very close.
Cheers
Dan

Is anyone else surprised at the cost of the campsites ($35.50 per night)? I don't remember paying anywhere near that at the rallies in VT or NY. The Motel 6 is around $60/night.

We went to both the NY Rally and VT Rally and camping was around the same price. In NY the campground was completely full of seasonal campers and everyone had to camp around or in an extremely hot field. In VT. the campground was very basic and tiny. At the KOA you will have a separate site with electricity and water and most have shade. A cool mountain river runs through the middle of it. We will have a 40x80 tent set up for meals, meetings and bands. If anyone has questions let me know! See you in July!

Well I have been waiting for 4 yrs to go to a INOA rally since 2011 and I really don't care if it is $15, $20 or $30 dollars more to camp there. I am ready and glad we have found a great camp ground to house us all that want to be riding in some of the best roads in the country. I say get you piggy bank and a hammer and smash it to pieces and get your bike ready and lets have some fun. If it is to much for anyone then you have the option to stay home and look at the pictures of the ones putting up their smiles in pic's. Can't wait. See you all in 5 months! Michael C. Harrod Ride those Nortons! TNOA

I am ready and glad we have found a great camp ground to house us all that want to be riding in some of the best roads in the country. I say get you piggy bank and a hammer and smash it to pieces and get your bike ready and lets have some fun. If it is to much for anyone then you have the option to stay home and look at the pictures of the ones putting up their smiles in pic's. Can't wait. See you all in 5 months!

In NY the campground was completely full of seasonal campers and everyone had to camp around or in an extremely hot field. In VT. the campground was very basic and tiny. At the KOA you will have a separate site with electricity and water and most have shade. A cool mountain river runs through the middle of it. We will have a 40x80 tent set up for meals, meetings and bands. If anyone has questions let me know! See you in July!

Thanks, Dan. I, too, made a reservation for a campsite and will bite the bullet and pay the rate. I have campsite G27. They said it was the best one left yesterday morning. I guess I must have water as the rate was 35.50. There is a motel 3.7 miles away, but I feel similar to you about riding back and forth. The rate there was 60 or 64 a night.

Besides, I figure if something comes up and I can't go I could probably "sell" the site for more (HaHa).

If I remember correctly, we paid for the campsite at the Blackthorne when we registered for the rally. I believe I paid $158 for the rally and camping. This one is running $100 for the rally (and doesn't include a t-shirt) plus about 250 for the campsite for a week. Yes, I realize that Ashville is a destination, but I am not heading there for Ashville, I am headed there to be with like-minded friends.

Go to Yahoo Maps, type "Hotels near Swannanoa, NC" and click Search.   There
are several in a cluster at I-40 at Tunnel Road.

There is also a list of them with their phone number on the INOA rally page under Accommodations.
